# RogaDev Password Generator

A very simple, lightweight password generator that I built in an couple hours. It takes a few parameters that allow you to decide whether you'll have special characters, capital and/or lower case letters, and numbers. Click to save to clipboard.

The live application is available at [passwords.roga.dev](https://passwords.roga.dev).

## Features

- Generate random, secure passwords
- Customize password options (length, character sets)
- Exclude specific characters
- Apply common password rules
- Copy to clipboard with one click
- Network activity monitoring
- Fully client-side (no server requirements)
- URL parameter support for sharing configurations
